# Soko-Mushi v1.0.1 Release Notes

## üÜï Version 1.0.1 Update

This update brings improved cross-platform compatibility and a more robust build process for Soko-Mushi!

### ‚ú® What's New

- **PySide6 Migration**: The GUI framework has been migrated from PyQt6 to PySide6 for better compatibility, especially on macOS and Linux. This ensures smoother builds and a more consistent user experience across all platforms.
- **Revised Build Script**: The build process is now more reliable and automated:
  - The build script now handles platform-specific options for Windows, macOS, and Linux.
  - Improved macOS support: The script ensures the app bundle icon is set correctly and Info.plist is updated automatically.
  - Optional renaming of the .app bundle for macOS, with post-build icon and Info.plist fixes.
  - Cleaner output and error handling.
- **General Improvements**:
  - Minor bug fixes and code cleanup.
  - Updated documentation for building and packaging on all platforms.

3. Select a folder to analyze
4. Explore your disk usage with the interactive tree view

### üêõ Known Issues

- Large directories (>100K files) may take time to scan

- On macOS, unsigned builds require right-click > Open to bypass Gatekeeper

### ‚ö†Ô∏è macOS Gatekeeper Note

If you see a "damaged" or "corrupt" warning when opening the app on macOS, this is due to Apple's Gatekeeper quarantine for unsigned apps. To resolve:

1. Open Terminal.
2. Run the following command (replace the path if needed):
   ```sh
   xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine ~/Downloads/soko-mushi-v1.0.1-mac.dmg
   ```
3. You can now open the app normally.

Alternatively, right-click the app and choose "Open" to bypass the warning for unsigned apps.
